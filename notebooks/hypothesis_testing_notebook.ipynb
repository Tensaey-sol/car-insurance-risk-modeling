    "This notebook conducts statistical hypothesis testing to validate or reject key hypotheses about risk drivers for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The analysis focuses on identifying low-risk segments to optimize marketing strategies and premium pricing for car insurance in South Africa. The key metrics analyzed are **Claim Frequency** (proportion of policies with at least one claim), **Claim Severity** (average claim amount when a claim occurs), and **Margin** (Total Premium - Total Claims). The results will inform a new segmentation strategy to attract low-risk clients with competitive premiums."

    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the statistical findings, the following recommendations are proposed to optimize ACIS's marketing and pricing strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Province-Based Pricing**: Do not implement regional pricing differences between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, as the data shows no significant risk variation. This simplifies marketing efforts and avoids unnecessary premium adjustments.\n",
    "2. **Zone-Based Risk Pricing**: Leverage the significant difference in claim frequency between high and low-risk zones (MainCrestaZone). Offer lower premiums in low-risk zones to attract new clients while adjusting premiums upward in high-risk zones to reflect increased claim frequency.\n",
    "3. **Gender-Neutral Pricing**: Maintain gender-neutral pricing, as no significant risk differences were found between male and female clients. This supports fair pricing practices and avoids potential regulatory scrutiny.\n",
    "4. **Monitor Margins by Zone**: While margin differences between high and low-risk zones were not statistically significant, the p-value (0.145) suggests potential differences. Collect additional data to confirm whether zone-based margin adjustments are warranted.\n",
    "5. **Refine Data Collection**: Address minor group imbalances (e.g., cubic capacity differences) by collecting more comprehensive data or refining segmentation criteria to ensure robust A/B testing in future analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expand Zone Analysis**: Further segment MainCrestaZone data to identify specific high-risk areas for targeted interventions.\n",
    "- **Incorporate Additional Features**: Explore other features (e.g., vehicle age, driver experience) in future hypothesis tests to uncover additional risk drivers.\n",
    "- **Validate with Larger Samples**: Increase sample size for margin analysis to improve statistical power and confirm trends.\n",
    "- **Integrate with Predictive Models**: Use these findings to inform machine learning models for premium optimization (Task 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides a solid foundation for ACIS to refine its segmentation strategy, focusing on zone-based risk differences while maintaining equitable pricing across provinces and genders."
